In order to make my project, I used flask, python, and html w/ inline css. In my python code, I was able to get all of the required data like nearest stop given a location. I used inline css to decorate the form that contained the input text box for the location and the submission button. I also used css to organize some of the text on the page. I was not able to connect the html form with the python code and thats why the form works but it does not return the expected results from the python function find_near_stop.
I could not figure out how to use the forms input in the html file to display the results of the find_near_stop function. I watched several youtube videos of others using flask and how they display their results from a form but none of them were using a python function to first get the input from the form and then put it back into the web app. It wasn't obvious enough in the Flask documentation nor did anyone have any similar issues on stackoverflow. 
After spending all that time working on the code, I wish I was able to figure out how to get the form to work with the python functions. I had initially attempted to use flash messaging in order to flash the user with the results but it would not directly work with the function and I kept getting several errors from writting bad html code {%%}.
